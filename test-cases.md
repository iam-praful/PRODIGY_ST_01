## ‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Cases

| Test Case ID | Test Description | Preconditions | Test Steps | Expected Result |
|--------------|------------------|---------------|------------|-----------------|
| TC_EDG_01 | Very large number addition | Calculator is on | Input: `999999999 + 1 =` | Result: `1000000000` or scientific notation |
| TC_EDG_02 | Long decimal precision | Calculator is on | Input: `1 / 3 =` | Result: `0.333...` |
| TC_EDG_03 | Multiple sequential operations | Calculator is on | Input: `5 + 2 * 3 - 1 =` | Result depends on operator precedence |
| TC_EDG_04 | Rapid key presses | Calculator is on | Input keys very fast | App does not crash or freeze |
| TC_EDG_05 | Clear button test | Calculator has a value | Press `C` or `AC` | Input should be reset to `0` |
